title: Fickleness and levels of content
---

# Issue 1

Levels of content can help to isolate problem elements, but they still have to be united enough to interact. See Anderbois et. al. on *weakly interacting meaning particles* (WIMPS).

# Issue 2

Negotiation is a form of higher order dynamism. The differences between content and use is baked into the infrastructure of the update system. 

In order for an element to be used, it must be integrated into the structure, but once it is integrated, it has its own inertia.

We have something of a *naked singularity* issue. The only known way to get around it is to broaden the scope of the isolation until a *fixed* entity can be produced.
