Questions and imperatives are non-trivial structuring updates conjoined with a preference relation defined over the partition. Conjecture essentially presumes a response in a way that questions and imperatives do not. That is, it is a non-trivial^[Whether it is genuinely non-trivial depends on our answer to the *relevant domain* question], non-definitive, structuring update.

Correction frequently targets what has been called a *homogeneity presupposition*; this is the idea that assertions involving plural subjects generally presume that the members of the denoted set are uniform with respect to the content of the predication (See von Fintel, Swarzschild 1994. See also Fodor 1970:159-67, Loebner 1987:183-5, Krifka 1996, Barker 1996). In our framework correction thus amounts to replacing a trivial partition with a non-trivial one.

The information state invovles three elements that can be updated: the common ground, the structuring store, and the preference ranking store. Questions and imperatives invovle trivial common ground updates, whereas assertions, conjectures, and corrections are non-trivial. In the structuring store, assertions, modal tests, and conjecture (depending on the *relevant domain*) are trivial, but questions, imperatives, and corrections are non-trivial.^[Notice that the inquisitive semantics folks also speak in terms of updates involving trivial parts.]

An alternative is to think of the common ground as itself preference marking. It carries the information of the preferred worlds within it. But we have access to a larger domain of worlds, and this domain is relevant for all structuring updates. In order to apply this idea, we require relations-in-intension. Otherwise, the information is lost, and thus not correctable, once the proposed update is applied.^[If corrections always immediately follow the conjecture, and conjectures merely propose updates, then the information is still present, and relations-in-extension would suffice.]

Structuring updates impose relations among the members of the common ground.

An imposed first-order update involves a trivial relation on the common ground and set intersection of it with another proposition.
A proposed first-order update involves a non-trival relation on the common ground and no direct action (that is, no intersection).

A similar distinction can be developed for second-order updates. That is, updates representing speech acts.
An imposed second-order update involves a relation-in-extension defined over the common ground. This is just a proposed, first-order update.
A proposed second-order update involves a relation-in-intension added to the structuring store. Thus, we add information without taking any information destroying action.

The introduction of structuring updates allows us to represent the distinction between proposed and imposed common ground updates. The virtue is that this allows us to avoid the information destroying effects of set intersection. But it doesn't represent the dynamic character of the distinction. What is interesting about the distinction is that it preserves information. But proposed first-order updates are themselves information destroying. They destroy the information on how to structure distinct common ground sets.

Murray adds an "acceptance" update (carried by the period mark) that activates the proposal evoked by the sentence. We are to take this acceptance update to be of the imposed variety. This update is needed in order to capture truth conditional import in Murray's system. But once the acceptance is made, the information is destroyed, and there is no going back. There are two issues where this causes a problem. The first is in conjoined updates. The second is with retraction and correction.

We, as conversationalists, track proposals as well as impositions. To account for retractions, we need access to the relations-in-intension of speech acts, not just their effect on the particular common ground to which they are proposed to apply. Simple structuring works fine for assertions, but conjectures allow for a more nuanced response, and nuanced response requires further articulation of the information state.

+ Static: Model theoretic semantics where assertions have as truth conditional content a set of worlds.
+ DRT: representations are built sequentially, evaluation takes place by means of a static model.
+ Dynamic semantics: Evaluation involves adjustments to assignment functions.
+ Update semantics: Evaluation involves additions to an information state.
+ Collaborative semantics: The evaluation of an utterance changes as conversation progresses.
