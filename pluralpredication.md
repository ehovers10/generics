title: Fickle and simple
chapter: Generics are collaborative
---


It is widely accepted that the quirkiness of characterizing generics requires that they be analyzed as generalized quantifiers. (It can't be treated as a simple relation between the subject and predicate.) There is sufficient variability in the nature of the relation between the subject and the predicate that extra logical structure is needed to afford space for that variability.

I'll start by making the problem more accute for the plural predication camp, and then show how a properly construed version of plural predication, one that involves contextual variation in a specific way can meet the variability demands, and do so in a way that is more appealing than the quantifier approach.

This poses a challenge for standard treatments of generics, which fall in to three categories based on their representation of their logical form:

\goop{ex}{lfoptions}

: (Varieties of logical form)

    > A's are B. \
      **Q**. $GEN(A)(B)$ \
      **N**. $\forall e (Ae \boxright_N Be)$ \
      **P**. $B(A)$

But generics aren't just quirky; they're also fickle. And their fickleness provides both the motivation and the groundwork for a solution to treating them as plural predications.

Standard kind-level approaches (Liebesman, McConnel-Ginet) don't provide enough variability to capture fickleness.

We need a contextual treatment, and Schwarzschild provides us with the groundwork for offering that.

The key is in the nature of the contextual variability. And fickleness is special because it demands both universality and something less.

I contend that what fickleness is all about is the *structural universalism* of generics. And the plurality approach is custom tailored to provide that structure.

Normalcy approaches go wrong in thinking that the universalism is modally restricted. Instead, it is structurally restricted.

It is most common to take generic *sentences* to be the subject of quirkiness[^non-linguistic], but the association of fickleness with generics suggests that a single generic sentence can be subject to different demands in different contexts. Each of the options outlined can be supplied with a contextual parameter. I will argue that the distinctive form of context sensitivity exhibited in fickleness makes the plural predication option preferable.

[^non-linguistic]: This contextual sensitivity of is significant because it suggests that quirkiness demands a linguistic treatment. This stands in contrast to a recent trend in the literature to consign quirkiness to the vagaries of conceptual [@leslie2007;@cohen2004] or metaphysical [@liebesman2011] instantiation.

Discourse like that in [Bears](#bears) is *coherent* in a way that requires a revision of how discourse evolves. Existing ways of dealing with fickle discourse evolution provide some insight into the phenomenon, but delving into them also reveals limitations to their ability to capture the specific issue of fickleness.

## Levels of content ([file](dimensions.pdf))

@vonfintel1997 and others have characterized homogeneity as a presupposition. It would thus exist on a different semantic dimension, and not result in a direct contradiction. The QUD model could be in this camp, too. As is the not-at-issue group. But all of these have trouble with the *evolution* of content, which is demanded by coherence.

## Context shifting ([file](shifty.pdf))

We have two opposing tendencies being displayed by bare plural sentences: they project homogeneity of the subject with respect to the predicate while simultaneously allowing for exceptions. They are both *strong* and *weak*. I contend that their strength is a feature of the semantics of predication -- the sentence simply applies the predicate to the class uniformly. Weakness, on the other hand, is a matter of the discourse role of the utterance. Bare plurals are useful for expressing *conjectures* -- utterances whose force extends beyond the evidence available to the speaker.

The reason that conjecture is appropriate is that the speaker can be confident that a collaborative hearer will negotiate with them if need be.

## Semantic negotiation ([file](negotiation.pdf))

One way of couching the contextualism/relativism distinction is in terms of whose context is relevant to the determination of truth values; contextualism says that the speaker's context matters, relativism that the hearer (judge, assessor) makes the call. I contend that what is going on in [Bears](#bears) is a form of semantic negotiation (Cf. @richard2004).
