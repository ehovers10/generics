*B*'s  response in [Teddy Bears](#teddy) is not a flat dismissal of *A*'s claim. Instead, it is a natural follow up, in that it seems to pick up on and develop the previously initiated theme. Another way to say this is that the *B*'s continuation represents a coherent advancement of the discourse. The existence of a resolvable coherence relation among a group of utterances is a prerequisite for interpreting the utterances in context. A particularly salient coherence relation may force an interpretation to light. For instance, consider the following example [due to @kehler2000, p. 539]:

\goop{ex}{presidents}

: (Presidents)

    > # Bill likes to play golf. George hates broccoli.

The dialogue is marked to indicate that it can seem somewhat stilted, resembling two independent sentences rather than a coherent story line. However, if we point out that the subjects in the two sentences can refer to past presidents and interpret the predicates as picking out the subjects' respective publicized traits, we impose a *parallel* relation on the two sentences and uptake goes through much more smoothly.

Kehler suggests that coherence relations imbue a discourse with an additional meaning that goes beyond the sum of its individual parts. He also maintains that linguistic coherence is subject to a Neo-Humean classification based on the basic forms of connection between idea. All connections among ideas, @hume1777 suggests, can be reduced to one of three principal ones: *Resemblance*, *Contiguity* in spacetime, and *Cause/Effect*.

Hume's reductive base is perhaps a bit too narrow. True, if we construe *resemblance* broadly enough, we can bring a wide swath of connections under its umbrella, but it seems to me that there are basic relations among ideas that Hume's reduction leaves out -- in particular, the set of relations corresponding to the *relative generality* of two ideas pertaining to the same domain. The relation of *part* to *whole* is a philosophical celebrity within the family of relative generality relations. That such a relation is a basic logical connection between ideas is emphasized by @goodman1940 in their classic explication of the calculus of individuals:

> "The relations of segments of the universe are treated in traditional logistic at two places, first in its theorems concerning the identity and diversity of individuals, and second in its calculus of membership and class-inclusion. But further relations of segments and of classes frequently demand consideration. For example, what is the relation of the class of windows to the class of buildings? No member of either class is a member of the other, nor are any of the segments isolated by the one concept identical with segments isolated by the other. Yet the classes themselves have a very definite relation in that each window is a part of some building. We cannot express this fact in the language of a logistic which lacks a part-whole relation between individuals unless, by making use of some special physical theory, we raise the logical type of each window and each building to the level of a class -- say a class of atoms -- such that any class of atoms that is a window will be included (class-inclusion) in some class that is a building. Such an unforutnate dependence of logical formulation upon the discovery and adoption of a special physical theory, or even upon the presumption that such a suitable theory could in every case be discovered in the course of time, indicates serious deficiencies in the ordinary logistic. Furthermore, a raising of type like that illustrated above is often precluded in a constructional system by other considerations govering the choice of pimitive ideas." [@goodman1940, p. 45]

The [Teddy Bears](#teddy) continuation, too, expresses a relative generality coherence relation. It is the flip-side of resemblance relations in that it highlights a *distinction* within a class that was previously over-looked. In moving from a coarser to a more granular conception of the sub-space of reality corresponding to beardom, the dialogue exhibits a relation of *refinement* between the ideas expressed in its utterances.

\goop{obs}{refinement}

: (Refinement)

    > Teddy Bears is a coherent dialogue, with the continuation acting as a refinement of the initiation.

The function of coherence relations is to improve interprebility of the discourse by imposing a restriction on the space of possible conceptions of what the initial speaker is getting at, thereby making the selection procedure for how to respond operate more smoothly. And refinement genuinely does help thin the space of possibilities, as we can see from the following alternative continuation:

\goop{ex}{druggy}

: (Druggy Bears)

    > **A**: Bears are dangerous.
      **B**: # Bears $in\;a\;drug-induced\;stupor_cf$ are dangerous.


While perhaps no less true than the original correction, I've marked the completion in *Druggy bears* to indicate the increased processing load it carries.[^processingload] This, I suggest, is because the completion expresses a less natural refinement of the discourse domain. As a result, discourse coherence is reduced.

[^processingload]: The claim that the [Druggy bears](#druggy) continuation does indeed carry a larger processing load is based upon my own interpretation of the discourse.

To say that [Teddy Bears](#teddy) is a coherent dialogue is not to deny its disputative tone. Still, the nature of the dispute differs from that in, for instance:

\goop{ex}{boars}

: (Boars)

    > **A**: Bears are dangerous.
      **B**: You mean $boars_cf$ are dangerous.

In *Boars*, the continuation breaks the flow of inquiry to attempt to fix a perceived error in the preceding discourse. In this example, the disputative *You mean...* is used to signal an attempted repair strategy.

The observation that [Teddy Bears](#teddy) exhibits a coherent discourse suggests that the disputative tone of its completion ought not to be treated as signaling a break in the inquiry. Instead, imposing the refinement relation on the discourse eliminates the sense of fault on the part of the initiation in allowing for proper uptake. Instead, we interpret the completion utterance as a *correction*, which is characterized by a dual function of providing: (i) a *denial* of some element of the preceding attempted contribution to discourse and (ii) a *positive contribution* that is related in a salient way to the preceding attempted contribution. A correcting utterance serves as an amendment to the discourse, and as such it crucially relies on the presence of an initiation. This is why discourse initial utterances rarely involve contrastive focus. A correct*ion* requires a correct*ible* to amend.

\goop{obs}{correction}

: (Correction)

    > The continuation of *Teddy Bears* serves to correct the initiation, which is itself a *correctible* utterance.

**A**'s retrenchment in [Teddy bears](#teddy) strikes my ear as an acceptable response to **B**'s challenge. It is similar to the data that @vonfintel2008 analyze in regard to retraction of *might* claims. Consider the following, [drawn from @vonfintel2008, p. 81]:

\goop{ex}{keys}

: (Keys)

    > **Alex**: The keys might be in the drawer.
      **Billy**: (*Looks in the drawer.*) They're not. Why did you say that?
      **Alex**: I didn't say they *were* in the drawer. I said they *might be* there -- and they might have been. Sheesh.

*Might* claims are sometimes retracted when presented with countervailing evidence available in a different context from the original utterance. But as [Keys](#keys-ex){: #keys-show .tooled} makes clear, *might* claims are ocassionally *resilient* in the face of such challenges. The felicity of the exchange in [Teddy bears](#teddy-bears-ex){: #teddy-bears-show .tooled} suggests that correctible initiations exhibit similar resilience.

<!-- Resilience -->
{% obs Resilience %}
  {{ site.data.observations.resilience | markdownify }}
{% endobs %}

A corrolary to the resilience of correctible initiations is that corrective completions don't simply link back to previous discourse and remove an element from the discourse representation. Instead, they add to the discourse in a specific way, thereby opening an avenue for the initial speaker to reject the alteration. That is, corrections are *productive*.

<!-- Productivity -->
{% obs Productivity %}
  {{ site.data.observations.productivity | markdownify }}
{% endobs %}

The exchange in [Teddy bears](#teddy-bears){: #teddy-bears-show .tooled} reveals an additional interesting fact about disputative discourse. Even if it is appropriate for an initiator to refuse to retract a correctible, the challenge provided byt the correction is no less appropriate. The flip-side of the resilience of correctibles is that they are also highly susceptible to challenge.

<!-- Susceptibility -->
{% obs Susceptibility %}
  {{ site.data.observations.susceptibility | markdownify }}
{% endobs %}

The dual observations of *resilience* and *susceptibility* provide an interesting obstacle to an analysis of the semantics and discourse dynamics of disputative language. *Susceptibility* pushes us toward a more strict representation of the content of the initiation to make sense of why it is appropriate to offer a correction to it. That is, it seems that utterances **A** and **B** in [Teddy bears](#teddy-bears){: #teddy-bears-show .tooled} represent a disagreement, and the most natural way to formalize disagreement is in terms of presentation of conflicting content.

But *resilience* pushes in the opposite direction. The **A**'s retrenchment, in so far as it is appropriate, naturally suggests compatibility between the initiation and the completion, which pushes us toward a less strict interpretation of the initiation content. Navigating between the rock of a correctible's tendency to elicit challenges and the hard place of their ability to withstand those challenges is a particularly interesting puzzle for a linguistic analysis of this type of discourse. But an adequate account should respect all of the observations catalogued above. To make them easier to refer to, all the observations are compiled below.
