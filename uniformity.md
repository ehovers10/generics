# Divisions

Plural forms

: Plural predication is implemented by a variety of syntactic structures. There are differences in the distribution of these various forms, but there is also an underlying semantic uniformity.

    + Bare plurals
    + Plural definites
    + Plural indefinites
    + Conjoined NPs

 Distributivity

: Plural predication sometimes applies to each element of the subject class and sometimes just to the group as a whole. It can also be even more nuanced, partially distributing through the set while grouping subsets.

    + Distributive predicates
    + Non-distributive predicates
    + Mixed cases (intermediate)

Generics

: Plural sentences can express a variety of relationships between subject and predicate, some of which demand different denotation types for the subject. They can express a form of generalization, an existence claim, or a predication of a property to a kind associated with the subject class.

    + Characterizing
    + Direct kind
    + Existential

# Problems for division

Ambiguity explosion

: The divisions admit of both *mixed* and *intermediate* cases. These exceptions suggest the need for a gradient of construals. If these are treated as distinct readings, which is the suggestion of ambiguity approaches, we get an explosion of distinct readings.

    + **Schwarzschild on distributivity**
    + Fickleness of characterizing generics

\goop{def}{mixed}

: (Mixed)

    > Plural predications that can be read as kind-referring in some contexts and characterizing generics in others.

\goop{def}{intermediate}

: (Intermediate)

    > Readings that fall somewhere between universals and existentials.

    > Quirkiness is intermediacy. It is both stronger and weaker than universals.
