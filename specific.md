# The problem

Say there are a couple bears that regularly visit our yard, and we've taken to calling them Jamie and Kelly. To speak of a recent visit, we could say \ref{names} or \ref{definite} but \ref{bare} would seem odd.

+ (**Trash**)
    a. Jamie and Kelly got into the trash again.\label{names}
    b. The bears got into the trash again.\label{definite}
    c. Bears got into the trash again.\label{bare}

In general, a use of a bare plural connotes an indeterminacy or lack of common knowledge of the group membership. This is a problem for the plurality-based acount, for it predicts that \ref{bare} should be a perfectly acceptable way to speak of the visit.

# The solution

The plurality-based account can capture the oddness \ref{bare} without recourse to logical form modification. There are a few options available:

Option 1

: it is possible to massage the context to eliminate the oddness of bare plurals used to refer to a specific group. Consider a situation in which we have a group of racoon visitors in addition to the bears, and each group leaves a distinctive trace after their visit.

Option 2

: The familiarity condition appears to be an implicature because it is cancelable.
    Bears got into the trash again. Not just any bears; Jamie and Kelly specifically.

Option 3

: Lack of specificity does not require existential quantification. Instead, this is just the standard dynamic account of bare plurals introducing a dref that can later be referred to. Following Dekker, drefs are not variables but underdetermined semantic objects. We do not need any adjustment to the LF at all.

Option 4

: Indeterminacy is a kind of not-at-issue content. It is probably a presupposition. This is the same sort of response that Gillies and Von Fintel (*Must...stay...strong*) use to explain the purported weakness of *must* as an evidential condition.
